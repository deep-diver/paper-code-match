## Introduction
This repository is made for the effort in matching between papers and their corresponding code blocks in machine learning field. 

## Project status
Currently, it is being experimented with the single paper, "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" or AlexNet. As the next step, it will be expanded to support multiple papers while showing the list of them in a board form. 

## How to start
1. Clone the repository
2. run `npm install`
2-1. if npm is not installed yet, please do

## Based project
Some part of this project's template is borrowed from [Distill](https://distill.pub). Their github repo, "post--example" can be found [here](https://github.com/distillpub/post--momentum) if you want to check out the original code base.
