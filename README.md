# Matching between papers and their code

## Introduction
This repository is made for the effort in matching between papers and their corresponding code blocks in machine learning field. 

## Project status
Currently, it is being experimented with the single paper, "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" or AlexNet. As the next step, it will be expanded to support multiple papers while showing the list of them in a board form. 

## Things to do
- [ ] Styling HTML style of the paper (HTML content will be generated by pdf2htmlEx converter first)
- [ ] Mouse event for text selection, context menu popup, and each menu action
- [ ] Mapping between selected(highlighted) text blocks to code block
- [ ] Fully working example for a single paper view (with the AlexNet paper)
- [ ] Hook with Gist account
- [ ] Managing list of papers 
- [ ] Managing mappings for each paper in external files

## How to start
1. Clone the repository

2. run `npm install`
   - if npm is not installed yet, please do

3. run `npm run dev`

4. go to the website at `http://localhost:8080` in your browser. (Google Chrome is prefered)

## Based project
Some part of this project's template is borrowed from [Distill](https://distill.pub). Their github repo, "post--example" can be found [here](https://github.com/distillpub/post--momentum) if you want to check out the original code base.
